# ARIC_Step

This repository contains the analysis code and results for the study deploying and comparing multiple open-source step counting algorithms in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.

## Study Overview

The study aims to deploy and compare five open-source step-counting algorithms (ADEPT, Oak, SDT, Verisense, and Stepcount) using wrist-worn accelerometry data from 1,150 older adults in the ARIC cohort. We examined step count distributions and their associations with health outcomes, providing insights into algorithm performance and implications for public health recommendations.

## Files and Structure

- **scripts/**: Contains all the analysis scripts used to process data and perform statistical analyses.
- **results/**: Includes results, figures, and output files generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions for use.
- **WIT_Step_R.Rproj**: R project file for easy navigation and project management.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:  

2. Install required packages and dependencies in R (see the `scripts` folder for package requirements).
3. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder to replicate the analysis.

## Key Results

- The algorithms showed significant variability in absolute step counts but demonstrated consistent trends in age-related step count declines and associations with various health outcomes.
- After standardization, the directionality and magnitude of associations with health outcomes were largely comparable across algorithms.
